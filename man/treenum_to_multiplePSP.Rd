\title{Assign Tree Numbers to Plots with Multiple PSP Instances}
\usage{
treenum_to_multiplePSP(Trees)
}
\arguments{
\item{Trees}{A \code{data.table} of tree observations containing PSP identifiers and measurement years.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} with updated and harmonized tree numbers across PSP entries.
}
\description{
Ensures consistent tree numbering in cases where the same Permanent Sample Plot (PSP) location appears multiple times across years.
This helps in tracking individual trees over time and prevents confusion caused by duplicated or missing IDs.
