\title{Process Implausible DBH Changes Across Measurement Years}
\usage{
process_dbh_issues(Trees, plots)
}
\arguments{
\item{Trees}{A \code{data.table} of tree measurements over time within PSPs.}
}
\value{
A cleaned \code{data.table} with problematic entries removed or flagged.
}
\description{
Detects and manages inconsistencies in tree diameter (DBH) measurements across years within PSPs.
The function flags implausible negative growth, cleans the dataset accordingly, and excludes plots with a high proportion of anomalies.
This helps improve the reliability of forest dynamics analysis.
